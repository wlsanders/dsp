[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

>> We would like to know how many males are between 5'10'' and 6'1'', so we first need to use scipy.stats._distn_infrastructure.rv_frozen so we can find both the mean and std. We then need to evaluate the CDF. We then find the lower amount and higher amount, which returns that 34.2% of the male population is between those two heights.
