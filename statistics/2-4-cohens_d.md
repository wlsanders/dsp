[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Using the variable totalwgt_lb investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohen's d to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length? 

The key thing we need to do is use the thinkstats2 CohenEffectSize equation that takes two variables. We are able to find that the Cohen d is -0.08867. The difference in means is -0.08867 standard deviations, which is small.
